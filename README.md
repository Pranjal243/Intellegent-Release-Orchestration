# Intellegent-Release-Orchestration
1. Project Scope and Features
DevOps Concepts to Include:
Version Control: GitHub for managing code and triggering pipelines.
CI/CD Pipeline: Jenkins/GitHub Actions to automate build, test, and deploy.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform/Ansible to provision infrastructure.
Containerization: Docker for packaging the application.
Orchestration: Kubernetes for managing and scaling containers.
Monitoring: Prometheus/Grafana for application and pipeline monitoring.
Logging: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logs.
ChatOps: Slack/MS Teams integration for real-time notifications and actions.
LLM Capabilities to Include:
Release Notes Automation: Use LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) to auto-generate release notes from commits.
Risk Assessment: LLM to analyze deployment configurations and logs for risks.
Rollback Plans: LLM to recommend rollback strategies for failed deployments.
Chatbot: ChatOps assistant to trigger deployments, check statuses, and provide insights.
